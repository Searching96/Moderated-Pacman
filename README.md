A Pacman game with some modified features:
- Pacman can chase you through walls.
- Only the player can teleport across the map by crossing the border, reappearing on the opposite side.
- When the player has remaining lives and touches a ghost, their position doesn't reset. Instead, they become invulnerable for 3 seconds.
